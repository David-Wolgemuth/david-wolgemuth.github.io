##Lot's of fun things can be done without a mouse.

Not all of them are very practical.  In fact, I wonder if anything that I did today will actually make things faster, or just more fun.

###Vimium

First, is Vimium, which is a way to us Vim-like commands to browse in Google Chrome.  See my [last post] (http://david-wolgemuth.github.io/2015/11/18/vim.html) to read about Vim.

For example the left-down-up-right is mapped to `h-j-k-l`.  And search is matched to `/` with its results scrolled through with `n` and `N`.  Opening a link is done using `f` and then typing whichever key is mapped to the link.

###W3M

While I definitely see myself using Vimium, I don't really see myself using W3M --- BUT, it is definitely fun to try out.  It is a browser that runs within the terminal.  This gives you a real retro, 80s looking browser.  Here's an example of how it would display google:


	Search Images Maps Play YouTube News Gmail Drive More >>
	Web History | Settings | Sign in

(you have to chuckle seeing "*[chrome-48] A better way to browse the web*" )
