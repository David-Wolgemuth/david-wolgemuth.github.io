Here are a few old projects I will remain proud of until I die.

### The classic game of mahjong

I had so much fun with this project and consider it the nail in the coffin of my deciding to pursue a career in software. No images were used, only rendered lines and shapes making it a tiny file. Producing the 3d stack illusion and registering mouse-clicks on the correct tiles was a nightmare.

### Wrath of the Wrectangles

10 levels of madness and various AI enemies who fly, jump and shoot at you.  Keeps track of high scores and unlocked levels.

### Asteroid Main

One-button FallDown-inspired game, optimized for mobile browsers.  Using the HTML 5 canvas and plain JavaScript, designed it to work best on mobile browsers.

You can play it [here](http://david-wolgemuth.github.io/asteroid-man/) or the 2.0 edition [here](http://david-wolgemuth.github.io/asteroid-man-2.0/).
