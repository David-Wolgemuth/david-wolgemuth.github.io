# Programmer Questionnaire

## Background

Becoming a professional computer programmer takes a lot of work and everyone's path is different.  It's important for me as your teacher to understand your goals and background so I don't waste your time teaching things your already know / don't care about.  But it is even more important for YOU to know, as you are the one who ultimately has to make the decision what to learn.

- WHAT are your goals
- WHY are these your goals
- HOW will you work to achieve your goals
